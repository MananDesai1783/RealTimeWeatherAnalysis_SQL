# Real Time Weather Analysis - SQL

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with designing a real-time weather monitoring and analysis system. The system should gather weather data from various locations, store it efficiently, and provide analytical insights to users.

## Solution Overview

1. Data Collection: 
Utilize a weather data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to obtain real-time weather information for various locations. Store weather data efficiently in the Weather_Data table, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

2. Data Analysis: 
Develop SQL queries to display real-time weather conditions for different locations. Calculate trends and patterns in weather data over time (e.g., hourly temperature changes, monthly precipitation trends). Integrate weather data with forecasting models to visualize potential future weather conditions. Utilizes advanced SQL features such as joins, window functions, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs) for complex analysis tasks. Implement features to calculate and display weather metrics such as average temperature, total precipitation, and highest wind speed for each location.

3. Data Maintenance: 
Implement mechanisms to periodically fetch new data from the weather data API and update the database accordingly. Ensure data consistency and accuracy by handling errors and exceptions during data retrieval and storage processes.

## Database Schema

A. Locations Table Columns: 

● location_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each location.

● location_name: Name of the location.

● latitude: Latitude coordinate of the location.

● longitude: Longitude coordinate of the location.

B. Weather_Data Table Columns: 

● data_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each weather data entry.

● location_id (Foreign Key): Reference to the location the data belongs to.

● timestamp: Timestamp of the weather data entry.

● temperature: Temperature recorded at the location.

● humidity: Humidity level recorded at the location.

● precipitation: Precipitation amount recorded at the location.

● wind_speed: Wind speed recorded at the location.

● weather_condition: Description of the weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy)
